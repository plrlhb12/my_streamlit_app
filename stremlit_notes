#### input data


### deploy to internet
1. get an account by sign into Streamlit
2. put your app on GitHub, create requirement.txt by executing belows

cd folder_of_interest
pip install pipreqs
pipreqs ./

go to githhub, create the new rep: my_streamlit_app
go to local 
cd my_streamlit_app
git init
git add .
git commit -m "fisrt commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:plrlhb12/my_streamlit_app.git # tricks using ssh url instead of http url, otherwise always ask for passwords and always failed to push
git push -u origin main

failed becasue the data file is too big
